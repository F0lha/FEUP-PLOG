These projects was developed for the unit course Logic Programming (PLOG) of the Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto.

The unit course objectives is to develop skills for abstract reasoning and declarative problem representation and for constraint logic programming.

The end result of this repository are a combination of several projects:

- An implementation of the [BreakThru Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)) logic with CLI and AI bots with several difficulty levels.
